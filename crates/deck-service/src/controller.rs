//! The one owner of a live session's terminal and its command injection.
//!
//! A [`SessionController`] owns the session's [`Terminal`] (a client may borrow it to render) and
//! its [`Injector`], and is the only path that writes injected commands into it. Every client —
//! the desktop's status bar, palette, dialogs and panels today, protocol clients later — submits
//! [`Command`]s through [`SessionController::submit`] with an explicit [`SessionTarget`] and a
//! client-chosen [`RequestKey`]:
//!
//! - The target is the session's stable [`SessionKey`] (backend namespace + session name, or a
//!   process-unique key for a direct terminal) plus a generation that changes whenever the
//!   session behind the key may be a different conversation (another session file, a new
//!   controller for a restarted process). A submission for any other target is
//!   [`Rejected::Stale`]: a click resolved against an old view never runs on a new one.
//! - Request keys are per-client monotonic. A key already accepted returns the original
//!   [`RequestId`] (never a second injection); a key reused for a different command is
//!   [`Rejected::KeyReused`]; a key at or below the client's highest accepted sequence that is no
//!   longer remembered is [`Rejected::Expired`], never run again. The bounded history only drops
//!   settled requests, never one that is queued, being written, waiting for a draft confirmation
//!   or waiting for omp to confirm a model switch.
//! - Outcomes separate delivery from runtime effect: [`Delivery::Delivered`] means every byte
//!   of the command reached the terminal, not that omp executed it. Only model switches have a
//!   runtime verdict ([`Runtime`]), from the session file / live model.
//!
//! The controller is driven by [`SessionController::drive`] (or [`SessionController::tick`] for
//! a headless owner that also pumps the terminal's events): it builds the injector's view of the
//! terminal, applies the input hold before any byte, writes, and reports [`ControllerEvent`]s.
//! It never sleeps; `wake_in` says when to drive again.
