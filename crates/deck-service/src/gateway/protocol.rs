//! The gateway wire protocol: handshake, typed requests and results, events and the binary
//! terminal frames of a frontend link. See [`super::wire`] for the framing.
//!
//! Connection kinds, chosen by [`Hello::attach`]:
//! - control: `Hello` → `Welcome`/`Refuse`, then [`Envelope`] requests answered by chunked
//!   [`Reply`]s (same id), interleaved with [`ServerEvent`]s. Events are small; state is fetched
//!   by query after a `Changed` (a lagging client gets one `Resync`, never an unbounded queue).
//! - frontend: `Hello{attach}` → `Welcome`/`Refuse`, then the terminal frames below. One
//!   connection per view, so a slow view only slows itself.
//!
//! Distinct failure classes: unsupported protocol / other profile / maintenance (handshake
//! [`Refusal`]), stale epoch or target, a closed transport (the client's own `Disconnected`), a
//! controller rejection ([`GatewayError::Rejected`]), an execution refusal
//! ([`GatewayError::Refused`]), a failed operation ([`GatewayError::Failed`]) and an uncertain
//! outcome after an owner crash ([`GatewayError::Uncertain`]).
