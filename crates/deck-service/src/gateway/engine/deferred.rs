//! Commands the gateway types into a session on its own schedule: `/reload-plugins` after a
//! plugin change (waits for omp to be idle) and `/resume <file>` with `force` (stops the running
//! turn first, then waits for omp to be idle). Both go through the session's controller like any
//! other injected command, so the idle checks, the draft confirmation and the TSP `send` apply.
//!
//! Requests typed here run under internal keys; their draft confirmations and ends reach the client
//! the work is for ([`Engine::deferred_owner`]), which may answer them. A client that cannot
//! answer any more (it left) never gets a command typed: nobody could confirm a draft, and an
//! unanswered confirmation would hold the session's injection queue.
