//! The worktree flows the desktop app and paired devices share: making a worktree at its default
//! location with its merge target recorded, moving a session into a new one, the finish flow
//! (the session is asked to commit and merge, the worktree is checked after each of its turns and
//! removed once clean and merged), removing or parking a worktree (its running sessions move into
//! the main checkout first), continuing a parked branch, the periodic look at parked branches and
//! the once-per-run cleanup of removed worktrees' leftover sessions.
//!
//! Commands typed into a session on a flow's behalf ([`Command::WorktreeFinish`],
//! [`Command::MoveTo`]) run under internal request keys (fresh ones per retry); their draft
//! confirmations and ends reach the client that started the flow, which may answer them.
